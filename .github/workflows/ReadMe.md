azure-dev.yml

The AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG secret typically contains configuration settings for your Azure environment. This can include various parameters required for provisioning and deploying your infrastructure and applications.

Here's an example of what you might store in AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG:

{
  "location": "eastus",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
  "environmentName": "myEnvironment"
}


In GitHub Actions, secrets are stored in the repository settings. Here's how you can add AZURE_CREDENTIALS to your repository secrets:

Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on the Settings tab.
In the left sidebar, click on Secrets and variables and then Actions.
Click the New repository secret button.
Add a name for your secret, in this case, AZURE_CREDENTIALS.
Paste the JSON string containing your Azure credentials into the Value field. It should look something like this:
{
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
  "tenantId": "your-tenant-id"
}
