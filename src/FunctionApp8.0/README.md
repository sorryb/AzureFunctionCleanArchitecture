# Azure Function with CleanArchitecture8

## Clean Architecture Concept

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of the business logic from the frameworks and tools used to implement it. The main goals of Clean Architecture are:

- **Independence of Frameworks**: The architecture does not depend on the existence of some library of feature-laden software. This allows you to use such frameworks as tools rather than having to cram your system into their limited constraints.
- **Testable**: The business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web Server, or any other external element.
- **Independent of UI**: The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the system. For example, a web UI could be replaced with a console UI without changing the business rules.
- **Independent of Database**: You can swap out Oracle or SQL Server for Mongo, BigTable, CouchDB, or something else. Your business rules are not bound to the database.
- **Independent of any external agency**: In fact, your business rules simply don’t know anything at all about the outside world.

The architecture is typically represented by a series of concentric circles, with the innermost circle representing the most abstract and high-level policies, and the outermost circle representing the most concrete and low-level details.

## Project Structure

This project is an implementation of an Azure Function using Clean Architecture principles. The main components of the project are:

- **Domain**: Contains the enterprise logic and types.
- **Application**: Contains the business logic and application services.
- **Infrastructure**: Contains the implementation of external services such as data access, messaging, etc.
- **FunctionApp**: Contains the Azure Function entry points and configuration.

## Function App

The `FunctionApp8.0` project is the entry point for the Azure Function. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing them, and returning appropriate responses. The main components of the `FunctionApp8.0` project are:

- **Function Triggers**: These are the entry points for the Azure Functions. They define how the function is triggered (e.g., HTTP requests, timers, etc.).
- **Bindings**: These define how data is passed to and from the function. For example, input bindings can be used to read data from a database, and output bindings can be used to write data to a storage account.
- **Configuration**: This includes the settings and configurations required for the function to run, such as connection strings, API keys, and other environment variables.

### Example Function

Here is a high-level overview of an example function in the `FunctionApp8.0` project:

1. **Trigger**: The function is triggered by an HTTP request.
2. **Input Binding**: The function reads data from a database using an input binding.
3. **Processing**: The function processes the data using the business logic defined in the `Application` and `Domain` layers.
4. **Output Binding**: The function writes the processed data to a storage account using an output binding.
5. **Response**: The function returns an HTTP response to the client.
